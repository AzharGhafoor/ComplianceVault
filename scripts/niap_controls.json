    "control_description": "The NIA Manual does not recommend any specific strategy or security controls for mitigating \nidentified threats, other than specifying baseline controls. The controls chosen by the Agency may be \neither technical or administrative and may confirm to one of the following strategies:\nAvoid Risk: Due to the inherent nature of risk it might be prudent to avoid the \u2018Risk\u2019 all together. For \nexample, modify or terminate the process that induces the risk. \nTransfer Risk: In some cases it may be advisable to transfer the risk to another entity. For example, \nsome operational risks may be taken care of by outsourcing. Another example might be providing an \ninsurance cover to mitigate the financial losses. However, the areas or services being outsourced \nremain the governance, compliance and risk management responsibility of the Agency. Please see \nTM1 in Third Part Security Management for more information on controls related to outsourcing.\nMitigate Risk: Most of the time it may not be possible to either avoid or transfer risk, also there may \nbe scenario\u2019s where critical processes need to be run in spite of the risks associated. In such scenarios \nit is necessary to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. This includes applying specific controls to \nreduce the consequences (impact) or the likelihood of the risk occurring. For example, installation of \neffective fire detection alarm system, along with a fire suppression system can effectively reduce the \nconsequence and likelihood of fire.\nAccept Risk: A thumb of rule in designing and implementing controls to mitigate risk is to ensure \nthat the cost of risk mitigation is not more than the cost of the information asset and / or the service it \nprovides (considering the legal and contractual obligations). Even after applying controls, the risk may \nstill not reduce to acceptable levels (Risk Appetite), in such cases the relevant authorities in the \nAgency need to decide if they are prepared to accept the risk",

The key step in preparing a BC Plan is conducting a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to identify the processes and functions critical to the Agency. The exercise is an extension to Information Classification exercise performed by the Agency. 1. Identify key processes and their owners within the Agency. 2. Identity process dependencies: information, applications, systems, networks, etc. 3. Identify the Availability requirements. This is A of the C-I-A triad (Confidentiality / Integrity / Availability). 4. Document time sensitiveness of key processes. For example: Availability requirement for payroll application is very high at month\u2019s end, while processing salaries. 5. Estimate tangible (Financial and Non-Financial) and intangible impacts, resulting from the inoperability of each critical function or service. 6. Define Maximum Tolerable Outage (MTO)* for the process. 7. Define the Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** for the process. 8. Based on the above calculate the Recovery Time Objectives (RTO). Agencies should use the results of the business impact analysis and threat and vulnerability assessment to develop and implement an information technology business continuity plan that will help enable the continuation of critical information technology processes and delivery of essential services, at an acceptable level, in the event of a disruption. The plan should also address. the recovery of agency information technology facilities and capabilities if those processes or \nservices fail. \nThe result of BIA along with the Threat Vulnerability assessment (Risk Assessment) would enable \nthe Agency in implementing controls to ensure availability of the process by mitigating the risks \nand in effect designing a suitable BC Plan.\nThe BCP should be updated regularly to ensure it is current and effective. The plan must be \napproved by the management should be tested.\n* Maximum Tolerable Outage (MTO): This is defined as the duration after which an organization\u2019s \nviability (either financially or through loss of reputation) will be irrevocably threatened if delivery \nof a particular product and service cannot be resumed.\n**Recovery Time Objective: This is defined as the target time frame for the restoration of a \nprocess or service after a disruption has occurred. RTO SHOULD be less than the defined MTO\n***Recovery Point Objective (RPO): This is defined as the point to which information must be \nrestored to enable an activity to operate once it is resumed\n",

Personnel may still \nhave to be moved to the hot site so it is possible that the hot site may be operational from a \ndata processing perspective before staff has relocated. The capacity of the hot site may or may \nnot match the capacity of the original site depending on the organizations requirements. This \ntype of backup site is the most expensive to operate. Hot sites are popular with organizations \nthat operate real time processes such as financial institutions, government agencies and \necommerce providers\nWarm Site:\nA warm site is a location where the organization can relocate to after a disruption, which is \nalready stocked with computer hardware similar to that of the original site, but does not \ncontain backed up copies of data and information. It may or may not have the same capacity \nas the original site depending on the organization's requirements.

It does \nnot include backed up copies of data and information from the original location of the \norganization, nor does it include hardware already set up. The lack of hardware contributes to \nthe minimal start-up costs of the cold site, but requires additional time following the disaster \nto have the operation running at a capacity close to that prior to the disaster",

At a minimum, the test should be for the most likely scenario with tests for less likely scenarios conducted as deemed necessary. The type and extent of testing will depend on the criticality of the business function supported by technology and the complexity of its processes and components. Business Continuity Tests may include any or all of the following: Table top Exercises: A table top exercise is a method of testing the business continuity plan that does not have a significant impact on daily operations. The business continuity team reviews and discusses the actions they would take to specific disruption scenarios as outlined in their plans, but they do not actually perform any of these actions. The exercise can be conducted with a single team or multiple teams as appropriate. Simulations / Workshops: A Test Scenario is compiled based upon realistic circumstances considering industry / location and potential threats. The team members will then be asked to invoke the plans (as per the BCP) and to perform their individual roles in order to recover \nfrom the scenario.\nPart Recovery Tests: In this scenario a disruption scenario is considered and a live \nrecovery is attempted. However, only a part of the process or function or infrastructure is \ntested. In some variants this may involve recovering certain functions, infrastructure etc, \nusually off-site without disturbing the live scenario.\nFull Recovery Tests: In this scenario, a disruption scenario is considered and the complete \nsystem, process or infrastructure is recovered usually on an alternative site as per the defined \nBCP. This usually involves a complete mobilization of the work force, management \nauthorization and carries a high risk as normal operations are affected. However the success \nof this test is a real indication of the effectiveness of the BCP developed by the team.",

Data storage security requirements: Security requirements for data at rest \n(storage) shall be governed by the classification of the data.

Encryption \ndetails such as encryption algorithm, hashing algorithm, and key length should be \nidentified and documented in the design document. Similarly, access \nrequirements should be identified. The design document should identify entities \nand resources. It should map the level of access between an entity and the \nresources in the system. \n6. Design audit logs: Agencies should identify the log requirements for effective \nmonitoring, administration and troubleshooting of the system. The log retention \nand management strategy should be agreed upon. System designers should \nensure that audit log assist not only in identifying system errors but also in co relating various other logs to identify system compromise patterns and / or \nattacks.\n7.

It is used throughout development to \ncommunicate what the software does or shall do. It is also used as an agreement \nor as the foundation for agreement on what the software shall do. \nThis document will capture the initial design requirements for the system / \napplication acquired and / or developed. Example: RFP / RFQ or any other \nsimilar document.\n2. Architecture / Design Document: Architecture documentation is a high level \ndesign document. In a way, architecture documents are third derivatives from the \ncode (design document being second derivative, and code documents being first). \nThe architecture documents do not contain anything specific to the code itself. \nThese documents do not describe how to program a particular routine, or even \nwhy that particular routine exists in the form that it does, but instead merely lays \nout the general requirements that would motivate the existence of such a routine. \nIt may suggest approaches for lower level design. \nDesign Document is a detailed low level document that contains Conceptual, \nLogical, and Physical Design Elements. It details the relationships and data flows \nbetween various entities. It identifies and documents the strategies how the \nsystem will implement and conform to identified requirements.\n3. Technical Documentation: When creating software, code alone is insufficient. \nThere must be some text along with it to describe various aspects of its intended \noperation. This documentation which includes How-to and overview \ndocumentation specific to the software application or software product being \ndocumented may be used by developers, testers and also the end customers or \nclients using this software application. Technical documentation has become \nimportant as more and more critical processes are automated and the related \nbasic and advanced level of information may change over a period of time with \narchitecture changes. \n4. Functional / User Documentation: User documentation describes each feature of \nthe program, and assists the user in realizing these features. A good user  document can also go so far as to provide thorough troubleshooting assistance. It \nis very important for user documents to not be confusing, and for them to be up \nto date. User documents need not be organized in any particular way, but it is \nvery important for them to have a thorough index. Consistency and simplicity are \nalso very valuable. \n5. Acceptance Test Reports: The final step in completion of software acquisition / \ndevelopment is testing the software to ensure its functionality and compliance \nwith the agreed design, standards etc. Agencies may conduct different kinds of \ntests to ensure to ensure final acceptance. These tests could include User \nAcceptance tests to ensure functionality, code reviews, penetration tests to test \nsecurity compliance, an audit to ensure compliance with NIA policies etc. All such \nreports shall be documented and action items highlighted in the reports shall be \nworked upon. \n6.

FIPS PUB \n140-3 being planned to be published in soon.\nThe different levels within the standard provide different levels of security and in the higher \nlevels, have different documentation requirements.\nLevel 1: The lowest level of security. No physical security mechanisms are required in the module \nbeyond the requirement for production-grade equipment.\nLevel 2: Tamper evident physical security or pick resistant locks. Level 2 provides for role-based \nauthentication. It allows software cryptography in multi-user timeshared systems when used in \nconjunction with a C2 or equivalent trusted operating system.\nLevel 3: Tamper resistant physical security. Level 3 provides for identity-based authentication.\nLevel 4: Physical security provides an envelope of protection around the cryptographic module. \nAlso protects against fluctuations in the production environment.\nThe Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (abbreviated as Common \nCriteria or CC) is an international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) for computer security certification. It \nis currently in version 3.1.[1]\nCommon Criteria is a framework in which computer system users can specify their security \nrequirements, vendors can then implement and/or make claims about the security attributes of \ntheir products and testing laboratories can evaluate the products to determine if they actually \nmeet the claims. In other words, Common Criteria provides assurance that the process of \nspecification, implementation and evaluation of a computer security product has been conducted \nin a rigorous and standard manner.\nEvaluation Assurance Level (EAL) - the numerical rating describing the depth and rigor of an \nevaluation. Each EAL corresponds to a package of security assurance requirements (SARs, see \nabove) which covers the complete development of a product, with a given level of strictness. \nCommon Criteria lists seven levels, with EAL 1 being the most basic (and therefore cheapest to \nimplement and evaluate) and EAL 7 being the most stringent (and most expensive).",

These certificates are used in conjunction with electronic signatures \nand advanced electronic signatures in accordance with \u201cDirective 1999/93/EC of the European \nParliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a community framework for electronic \nsignatures\u201d [Dir.1999/93/EC].\nThis CWA is specifically relevant for manufacturers of Trustworthy Systems (TWSs) used for \nmanaging certificates. It provides an overview of a CSP system broken down into a number of \nservices. Some of these services are mandatory, termed \u2018Core Services' whereas others are \noptional, \u2018Supplementary Services'.\nCore Services covers the following CSP services:\na. Registration Service - to verify the identity and, if applicable, any specific attributes of a \nSubject\nb. Certificate Generation Service - to create certificates;\nc. Dissemination Service - to provide certificates and policy information to Subjects and \nRelying Parties;\nd. Revocation Management Service - to allow the processing of revocation requests;\ne. Revocation Status Service - to provide certificate revocation status information to relying \nparties.\nSupplementary Services covers two optional CSP services:\na. Subject Device Provision Service \u2013 to prepare and provide a Signature Creation Device \n(SCDev) to Subjects. This includes Secure-Signature-Creation Device (SSCD) provision;\nb. Time-stamping Service \u2013 provides a Time-stamping Service which may be needed for \nsignature verification purposes.\nA CSP must implement systems that provide all Core Services. \nThis specification provides standards for Trustworthy Systems (TWSs) providing Core and \nSupplementary Services, issuing both Qualified Certificates (QCs) and Non-Qualified Certificates \n(NQCs). Meeting the requirements for issuing of QCs automatically implies meeting the \nrequirements for issuing NQCs.",
